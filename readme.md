# Welcome to Apollo & GraphQL
This document contains information needed to follow today's lunch and learn. If you have further questions feel free to ask me!

## What is GraphQL?
GraphQL is a query language designed to be layered on top of your API created by Facebook. GraphQL consolidates all would be endpoints that could be for your api in to one place. Not only that but GraphQL allows your define your data for your client and gives your client side full control of what is retrieved. GraphQL is also heavily typed to allow for more clear definition of the data. As a developer Graphql also comes with a query testing environment called `Graphiql` that allows for quick checks on the GraphQL Schema. For more information on GraphQL follow this link: `https://graphql.org/`

## What is Apollo?
Apollo for GraphQL is a technology that expedite the process of building a GraphQL Endpoint on top of an existing backend. Apollo is composed of 3 parts, the `Client`, the `Server` and the `Engine`. For this lunch and learn there will be a focus on the `Client` portion of Apollo. The `Server` and `Engine` portions will only be briefly mentioned. In General, when applying Apollo with GraphQL, it becomes easier to develope frontend code with GraphQL and it also improves the performance of the existing endpoint the technologies are applyed on. More information that can probably explain Apollo better than I, can be found here `https://blog.meteor.com/the-meteor-chef-an-introduction-to-apollo-b1904955289e`.
